-> Connecting the HC-05 Bluetooth Module to Arduino

VCC → 5V (Arduino) (Powers the Bluetooth module)
GND → GND (Arduino) (Common ground connection)
TX → RX (D2 on Arduino) (Bluetooth sends data to Arduino)
RX → TX (D3 on Arduino) (Arduino sends data to Bluetooth, use voltage divider if needed)

  
-️> Connecting the Relay Module to Arduino

Relay IN → Digital Pin 13 (Arduino) (Signal to turn the relay ON/OFF)
Relay VCC → 5V (Arduino) (Powers the relay module)
Relay GND → GND (Arduino) (Common ground with Arduino)
️Connecting the Light Bulb (AC Load) to the Relay
Live Wire (from AC Supply) → COM (Common Pin on Relay)
NO (Normally Open) → Live Wire of the Light Bulb
Neutral (from AC Supply) → Neutral of Light Bulb


-> How It Works

When Arduino sends HIGH (1) to the relay, it closes the circuit, turning the light ON.
When Arduino sends LOW (0) to the relay, it opens the circuit, turning the light OFF.
